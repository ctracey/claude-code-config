# Security Way

## Defaults

- Parameterized queries for all database access
- Escape output for its context (HTML, URL, SQL)
- Validate at system boundaries (user input, external APIs)
- Principle of least privilege for permissions

## When Reviewing Existing Code

Flag these as security issues:
- Hardcoded secrets or credentials
- SQL string concatenation
- Unsanitized user input in templates or commands
- Missing authentication/authorization on endpoints
- Sensitive data in logs
