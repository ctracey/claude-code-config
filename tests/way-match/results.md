# Way-Match Test Results

**Historical**: These results compare BM25 vs NCD (gzip) from when NCD was the baseline matcher. NCD has since been removed — the matching engine is now embedding → BM25 → regex-only. These results are preserved as a record of why NCD was retired.

Last run: 2026-02-17

## Fixture Tests (synthetic corpus)

32 test prompts scored against a fixed 7-way corpus. Both scorers use a curated vocabulary and description per way.

### Fixture test interpretation

| Metric | BM25 | NCD |
|--------|------|-----|
| True positives | 20/26 (77%) | 18/26 (69%) |
| False positives | 0/6 (0%) | 0/6 (0%) |
| Overall accuracy | 26/32 (81%) | 24/32 (75%) |

Both scorers achieve zero false positives — neither fires on unrelated prompts. BM25 wins on recall: it catches more true matches, particularly on prompts where vocabulary terms appear in stemmed or derived forms (e.g., "pytest fixtures" → testing, "caching layer built this way" → adr-context).

NCD wins 2 tests where byte-level compression similarity catches patterns that term-frequency misses: "verify the service handles bad input gracefully" (testing) and "how do the microservices talk to each other" (design). These are cases where the prompt shares no vocabulary terms but compresses well against the description.

The 4 shared false negatives (both scorers miss) represent genuine vocabulary gaps — prompts using synonyms or domain jargon not present in any way's vocabulary or description.

## Integration Tests (real way files)

31 test prompts scored against actual way files extracted from the live ways directory. This tests the real pipeline: frontmatter extraction, vocabulary parsing, threshold behavior.

### Integration test interpretation

| Metric | BM25 | NCD |
|--------|------|-----|
| True positives | 23/27 (85%) | 14/27 (52%) |
| False positives | 0/4 (0%) | 3/4 (75%) |
| Overall accuracy | 27/31 (87%) | 15/31 (48%) |

The integration test reveals the real-world gap. Against live way files with their actual vocabulary and thresholds, BM25 achieves 87% accuracy with zero false positives. NCD drops to 48% — and critically, produces 3 false positives on negative-control prompts ("what is the capital of France", "tell me about photosynthesis", "write a haiku about rain").

**Why NCD struggles with real ways**: The live vocabulary fields are larger and more varied than the synthetic corpus. NCD's compression-distance metric becomes less discriminating as document size grows — more bytes mean more incidental compression overlap. BM25's term-frequency scoring scales cleanly because it weights individual term matches, not byte patterns.

**Interesting BM25 failures**:
- "bisect to find which commit broke it" — scores 1.68 against debugging (threshold 2.0). The verb "bisect" isn't in the vocabulary despite being a classic debugging technique.
- "are our API keys exposed anywhere" — matches API (2.68) instead of security (1.59). "API keys" triggers the API way's vocabulary harder than "exposed" triggers security.
- "the database connection string needs updating" — matches design (2.28) over config (1.79). "database" and "connection" appear in design's vocabulary.

These failures are addressable by tuning vocabulary and thresholds — which is the point of running these tests.

## Interpreting the Metrics

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **TP** (True Positive) | Prompt correctly matched to the expected way |
| **FP** (False Positive) | Prompt incorrectly matched when it shouldn't have been |
| **TN** (True Negative) | Unrelated prompt correctly rejected by all ways |
| **FN** (False Negative) | Prompt should have matched a way but didn't |

For way matching, **false positives are worse than false negatives**. A false negative means missing an opportunity to inject guidance — the agent still works, just without the extra context. A false positive means injecting irrelevant guidance, wasting context tokens and potentially confusing the agent.

Both scorers prioritize precision (low FP) over recall (low FN), which is the right trade-off for this system.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Both test suites
tests/way-match/run-tests.sh

# Fixture tests only (BM25 vs NCD, synthetic corpus)
tests/way-match/run-tests.sh fixture --verbose

# Integration tests only (real way files)
tests/way-match/run-tests.sh integration

# Individual harnesses directly
bash tools/way-match/test-harness.sh --verbose
bash tools/way-match/test-integration.sh

# Via Makefile
make test              # fixture tests (verbose)
make test-integration  # integration tests
make test-bm25         # BM25 only
make test-ncd          # NCD only (no binary needed)
```

## Known Limitations

**Pair mode IDF corpus size.** In `pair` mode (used by the hook scripts), BM25 computes IDF against a built-in background corpus of 7 ways hardcoded in `way-match.c`. This is balanced for the ~20 ways that ship with the repo — the 7 entries cover the semantic domains well enough for IDF to discriminate effectively, as the test results above show. But IDF resolution depends on corpus size: if you scale to a significantly larger ways set (50+), terms that should be distinctive may appear "common" relative to an undersized background. Two options if you get there:
- **Expand the built-in corpus**: Add representative entries to the `BUILTIN_WAYS` array in `way-match.c` (one per domain is enough) and rebuild with `make local`. This keeps pair mode's simplicity — no extra files needed at runtime.
- **Switch to score mode**: Generate a JSONL corpus from your live way files and use `way-match score --corpus ways.jsonl` instead of `pair`. This gives BM25 the full document set for IDF — the integration test already demonstrates this pattern.

## When Results Change

If you update a way's `vocabulary:` or `threshold:`, re-run the integration tests. If you modify `way-match.c` or rebuild the binary, run both suites. Update this file when baselines shift significantly — the numbers here serve as a reference point for regression detection.
